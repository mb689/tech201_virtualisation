# DevOps and Development Environments 

## DevOps



## Reason for a DevOps Engineer
- Ease of use -> User friendly tools for all works in the project
- Flexibility -> Able to change tech based on business needs
- Robustness -> Aim for 100% uptime
- Cost -> Lower cost used to complete tasks

## Infrastructure and architecture
- Monolith - Everything needed to run a software/app (storage) is placed all in one machine. Problem with this is if the big machine is down then it will effect the entire app/software
- 2 Tier architecture - This is a concept where everything needed to run an app is shared between two different machines. This is much better than monolith as if one goes down then the app or software can still run for users.
- Microservices - This infrastructure allows us to break up the needs of the app into different machines. Containers are the thing used to implement a microservice infastructure.
